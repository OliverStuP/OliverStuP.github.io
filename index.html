<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I am Oliver Page. I am an upcoming web developer who has had an interest in writing code since college. I first learnt to use a computer since I was about 3 or 4, and I have seen the potential these machines have on our society ever since. I chose to take IT as a subject during college, and I quickly grew fascinated with writing code whilst working on projects involving web and game design. I wrote a currency converter the website I was to produce and realised just how efficient programs are towards peopleâ€™s lives. Hence, I wanted to pursue the subject as a career path.</p><br>
<p>I also have an interest in the engineering side of computing, another skill I picked up during college. Ever since learning how to put a PC together, I have been collecting used desktops to give them a new lease of life.</p><br>
<p>My interests outside of computing include photography and minding cats. My goal is to one day use my expertise in coding to create a game.</p><br>

<h2>What I do:</h2>
<p>I have expertise in designing websites in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. Appropriate knowledge in these languages is perfect for those who require a functioning website. I also have some experience in Python and Java, meaning that I'm flexible in what languages clients want me to write in. I have written code for websites as part of my college and university education, as well as for my parents' rental business. I am hoping that my time as a freelancer will allow me to develop my skills further.
</p><br>

<p>Outside of coding, I have some knowledge on troubleshooting network issues as well as producing virtual machines that can operate Linux. I am capable of computer engineering as well, having been able to produce a working PC for my parents from a system that was previously left in the attic. Finally, I am capable of removing viruses and other malware that can affect more vulnerable users such as the elderly or others who were not educated on the threats that lurk the internet.</p><br>
