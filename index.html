<section id="about">
<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am Oliver Page, a Computing and IT undergraduate with experience in web development, object-oriented programming and game development. I first learnt to use a computer since I was about 3 or 4, and I have seen the potential these machines have on our society ever since. I chose to take IT as a subject during college, and I quickly grew fascinated with writing code whilst working on projects involving web and game design. I wrote a currency converter the website I was to produce and realised just how efficient programs are towards people's lives. Hence, I wanted to pursue the subject as a career path.</p><br>
<p>I am eager for opportunities to apply and develop my skill set further. Any job will be completed punctually and I am willing to work with a variety of languages including C++.</p><br>
<p>I also have an interest in the engineering side of computing, another skill I picked up during college. Ever since learning how to put a PC together, I have been collecting used desktops to give them a new lease of life.</p><br>
<p>My interests outside of computing include photography, chess, cycling, minding cats and writing ideas for games. My goal is to one day use my expertise in coding to create a game.</p><br>

<section id="services">
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>I have expertise in designing websites in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. Appropriate knowledge in these languages is perfect for those who require a functioning website.</p> 
<p>I also have experience in programming languages; including C++, Python, Lua and Java, meaning that I'm flexible in what languages clients want me to write in. I have written code for websites and programs as part of my college and university education, as well as for templates and Game Jams to practice my skills. Debugging is another task I am capable of. I am hoping that my time as a freelancer will allow me to develop my skills further.
</p><br>

<p>Outside of coding, I have some knowledge on troubleshooting network issues as well as producing virtual machines that can operate Linux. I am capable of computer engineering as well, having been able to produce a working PC for my parents from a system that was previously left in the attic.</p><br>

<p>Finally, I am capable of removing viruses and other malware that can affect more vulnerable users such as the elderly or others who were not educated on the threats that lurk the internet.</p>
